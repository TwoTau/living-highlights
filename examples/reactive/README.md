# Reactive Article Example

A basic demonstration of an interactive Living Papers article that leverages the reactive runtime. This example produces both HTML and LaTeX versions, testing the conversion of an interactive document to a static one.

Run `npm run build` to compile the article. This example requires a working LaTeX installation: `pdflatex` must be accessible via the command line.

This example demonstrates:

- Both HTML and PDF/LaTeX output
- Interactive updates in HTML output using the reactive runtime
- Conversion of interactive content to static figures and text
