# The Barnes-Hut Approximation

A Living Papers version of the interactive article [The Barnes-Hut Approximation: Efficient computation of N-body forces](https://jheer.github.io/barnes-hut/). This example produces an interactive web page.

Run `npm run build` to compile the article.

This example demonstrates:

- Adding custom web components
- Adding custom stylesheets
- Action links to update the reactive runtime state
- Binding multiple inputs to a shared reactive variable
- A "sticky" figure that persists throughout the article
