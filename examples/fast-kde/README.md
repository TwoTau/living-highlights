# Fast & Accurate Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation

A Living Papers version of the VIS '21 short paper [Fast & Accurate Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/fast-kde/). This example produces both an HTML version and a publication-ready PDF version via LaTeX.

Run `npm run build` to compile the article. This example requires a working LaTeX installation: both `pdflatex` and `bibtex` must be accessible via the command line.

This example demonstrates:

- Both HTML and PDF/LaTeX output
- Use of a LaTeX template to match an existing published paper
- Automatic conversion of SVG images to LaTeX-compatible PDFs
- A BibTeX `bibliography` included directly within the document
- Use of the `\place{...}` directive to position LaTeX figures
